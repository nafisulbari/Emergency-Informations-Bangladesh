# Emergency Informations Bangladesh

This is an information management system project for my System Analysis and Design lab.

Here every citizen will have a unique id and QR code.

With the id or QR, citizens will be able to view emergency information(name, blood group, emergency contact) of another citizen. Also, hospitals and police stations will be able to manage medical records and criminal records efficiently.

Multi-user authentication, image uploads, text formatting, viewing data in graphs, QR code generations and many other features are implemented in this project.

## Build and Run

1. Clone the repo and open with your favorite IDE

2. Let your IDE automatically download the dependencies

3. Create a MySql database by name **eib**

4. Import the **database-backup/eib-bk.sql** file into your MySQL server

5. Open the application.properties file and set your database credentials

6. Run the app and goto [http://localhost](http://localhost/)
